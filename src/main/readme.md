# ChestDrop

A Minecraft plugin for Spigot/Paper servers that automatically collects mob drops into a chest and places the chest directly into the killer's inventory. If the inventory is full, the player is notified and the drops fall on the ground as usual.

## Features
- When a player kills a mob, all drops are collected into a virtual chest.
- The chest is added to the player's inventory.
- If the inventory is full, the player receives a message and drops fall normally.
- Simple, lightweight, and easy to use.


## Usage
- Kill any mob as a player.
- If you have space in your inventory, a chest containing the mob's drops will be added to your inventory.
- If your inventory is full, you will see a red message and the drops will fall on the ground.

## Compatibility
- Tested with Spigot/Paper 1.19.4. Should work with most recent versions.
